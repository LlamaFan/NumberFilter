Hello, this project is just a little fun thing I did. 
It is about giving an image as an input and getting the image back, but instead of the normal pixel it's plain text. 
Although this may not is the cleanest code, as it's only a side projetct I hope you still might enjoy it.

You may use this project for yourself as much as you like, but if you use it for other purposes then credit me
Thank you <3
